# About #

This is _pulseaudio-dlna_. A small DLNA server which brings DLNA / UPNP
and Chromecast support to PulseAudio and Linux.

It can stream your current PulseAudio playback to different UPNP devices
(UPNP Media Renderers) or Chromecasts in your network.
It's main goals are: easy to use, no configuration hassle, no
big dependencies.

UPNP renderers in your network will show up as pulseaudio sinks.

Some community members are providing packages for others distributions.
_Keep in mind that since i am not using those, i can hardly support them!_

- Arch Linux
    [https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pulseaudio-dlna/](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pulseaudio-dlna/)
- openSUSE (_.rpm_)
    [http://packman.links2linux.de/package/pulseaudio-dlna](http://packman.links2linux.de/package/pulseaudio-dlna)
- Fedora - RHEL - CentOS - EPEL
    [https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/cygn/pulseaudio-dlna/](https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/cygn/pulseaudio-dlna/)

## Installation via git ##

Other linux users can clone this git repository,
make sure you have all the dependencies installed and the PulseAudio DBus module
is loaded.

### Basic requirements ###

These are the requirements _pulseaudio-dlna_ acutally needs to run. These dependencies
will get installed if you install it via the PPA.

- python2.7
- python-pip
- python-setuptools
- python-dbus
- python-beautifulsoup
- python-docopt
- python-requests
- python-setproctitle
- python-gobject
- python-protobuf
- python-notify2
- python-psutil
- vorbis-tools
- sox
- lame
- flac
- faac
- opus-tools

You can install all the dependencies in Ubuntu via:

    sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-pip python-setuptools python-dbus python-beautifulsoup python-docopt python-requests python-setproctitle python-gobject python-protobuf python-notify2 python-psutil vorbis-tools sox lame flac faac opus-tools

### PulseAudio DBus module ###

Since version _0.2.2_ the DBus module should be loaded automatically, if it was
not loaded before.
It that does not work, you can load the DBus module in Ubuntu via the following
command. Note that you
have to do this every time you restart PulseAudio (or your computer).

    pacmd load-module module-dbus-protocol

Or to make changes persistant edit the file `/etc/pulse/default.pa` with your
favorite editor and append the following line:

    load-module module-dbus-protocol

### Install it local ###

The recommend method of using _pulseaudio-dlna_ is to install it local to a
python _virtualenv_. In that way you will keep your system clean. If you don't like
it anymore, just delete the folder.
For that method you need some additional dependencies.

#### virtualenv requirements ####

- python-virtualenv (Ubuntu <= _14.04 Trusty LTS_)
- virtualenv (Ubuntu >= _14.10 Utopic_)
- python-dev

So all Ubuntu versions prior to _14.10 Utopic_ need to install:

    sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv python-dev

All Ubuntu versions above install:

    sudo apt-get install virtualenv python-dev

#### Installing & starting ####

Change to the _project root folder_ and start the installation via:

    make

After that you can start _pulseaudio-dlna_ via:

    bin/pulseaudio-dlna

### Install it to your system ###

Since some people like it more to install software globally, you can do that too.
In many software projects this is the default installation method.

#### Installing & starting ####

Change to the _root folder_ and start the installation via:

    make install

After that you can start _pulseaudio-dlna_ via:

    pulseaudio-dlna

### Using ###

_pulseaudio-dlna_ should detect the ip address your computer is reachable within
your local area network. If the detected ip address is not correct or there
were no ips found, you still can specifiy them yourself via the host
option (```--host <your-ip>```)

Right after startup it should start searching for UPNP devices in your LAN and
add new PulseAudio sinks.
After 5 seconds the progress is complete and you can select your UPNP renderers
from the default audio control.

In case you just want to stream single audio streams to your UPNP devices you
can do this via `pavucontrol`.

You can install `pavucontrol` in Ubuntu via the following command:

    sudo apt-get install pavucontrol

Note that _pulseaudio-dlna_ has to run all the time while you are listening to
your music. If you stop _pulseaudio-dlna_ it will cleanly remove the created
UPNP devices from PulseAudio and your UPNP devices will stop playing.

Since 0.4, new devices are automatically discovered as they appear on the network.

### CLI ###

    Usage:
        pulseaudio-dlna [--host <host>] [--port <port>] [--encoder <encoder>] [--bit-rate=<rate>] [--filter-device=<filter-device>] [--renderer-urls <urls>] [--debug] [--fake-http10-content-length] [--fake-http-content-length] [--disable-switchback] [--disable-ssdp-listener]
        pulseaudio-dlna [-h | --help | --version]

    Options:
           --host=<host>                       Set the server ip.
        -p --port=<port>                       Set the server port [default: 8080].
        -e --encoder=<encoder>                 Set the audio encoder.
                                               Possible encoders are:
                                                 - mp3   MPEG Audio Layer III (MP3)
                                                 - ogg   Ogg Vorbis
                                                 - flac  Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)
                                                 - wav   Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)
                                                 - opus  Opus Interactive Audio Codec (OPUS)
        -b --bit-rate=<rate>                   Set the audio encoder's bitrate.
        --filter-device=<filter-device>        Set a name filter for devices which should be added.
                                               Devices which get discovered, but won't match the
                                               filter text will be skipped.
        --renderer-urls=<urls>                 Set the renderer urls yourself. no discovery will commence.
        --debug                                enables detailed debug messages.
        --fake-http-content-length             If set, the content-length of HTTP requests will be set to 100 GB.
        --disable-switchback                   If set, streams won't switched back to the default sink if a device disconnects.
        --disable-ssdp-listener                If set, the application won't bind to the port 1900 and therefore the automatic discovery of new devices won't work.
        -v --version                           Show the version.
        -h --help                              Show the help.

Samples:
- `pulseaudio-dlna` will start
_pulseaudio-dlna_ on port _8080_ and stream your PulseAudio streams encoded
with _mp3_.
- `pulseaudio-dlna --encoder ogg` will start
_pulseaudio-dlna_ on port _8080_ and stream your PulseAudio streams encoded
with _Ogg Vorbis_.
- `pulseaudio-dlna --port 10291 --encoder flac` will start
_pulseaudio-dlna_ on port _10291_ and stream your PulseAudio streams encoded
with _FLAC_.
- `pulseaudio-dlna --filter-device 'Nexus 5,TV'` will just use devices named
_Nexus 5_ or _TV_ even when more devices got discovered.
- `pulseaudio-dlna --renderer-urls http://192.168.1.7:7676/smp_10_`
won't discover upnp devices by itself. Instead it will search for upnp renderers
at the specified locations. You can specify multiple locations via urls
seperated by comma (_,_). Most users won't ever need this option, but since
UDP multicast packages won't work (most times) over VPN connections this is
very useful if you ever plan to stream to a UPNP device over VPN.

## Troubleshooting ##

Some devices do not stick to the HTTP 1.0/1.1 standard. Since most devices do,
_pulseaudio-dlna_ must be instructed by CLI flags to act in a non-standard way.

- `--fake-http10-content-length`

    Adds a faked HTTP Content-Length to HTTP 1.0 responses. The length is set 
    to 100 GB and ensures that the device would keep playing for months.
    This is necessary for the _Hame Soundrouter_.
